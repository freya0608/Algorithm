Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.

`For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".`

Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd").
```
/**
 * @param {string} A
 * @param {string} B
 * @return {number}
 */
var repeatedStringMatch = function(A, B) {
    var n = B.length/A.length;
    var str = "";
    for(var i = 1; i<n+5; i++){
        str += A;
        if(str.indexOf(B)>=0){
           return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;

};
```
