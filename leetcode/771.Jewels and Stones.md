You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels,
 and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.
  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters.
 Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

    Example 1:

            Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
        Output: 3
        Example 2:

        Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
        Output: 0

    Note:

        S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
        The characters in J are distinct.

var  numJewelsInStones = function(J,S)
{
    var result = 0;
    var jlen = J.length;
    var slen = S.length;
    for (var i = 0; i < slen; i++) {
        for (var j = 0; j < jlen; j++) {
            if (S[i] == J[j]) {
                result++;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}
