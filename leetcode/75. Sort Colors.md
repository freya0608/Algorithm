Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Example:

```
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```
```
var sortColors = function(nums) {
    let i = -1, j = -1, k = -1;
    for (let num of nums) {
        switch(num) {
            case 0:
                nums[++k] = 2;
                nums[++j] = 1;
                nums[++i] = 0;
                break;
            case 1:
                nums[++k] = 2;
                nums[++j] = 1;
                break;
            case 2:
                nums[++k] = 2;
                break;
        }
    }

};
```
